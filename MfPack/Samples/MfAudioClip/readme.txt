  uncompressed media data from a media file.

  This sample application reads audio data from a media file and
  writes the uncompressed audio to a WAVE file.
  The input file must be a media format supported by Media Foundation,
  and must have  an audio stream. The audio stream can be an encoded
  format, such as Windows Media Audio.
 
  The original Microsoft sample, is a console app. 
  This sample, however, is not.
